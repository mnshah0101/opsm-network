## Introduction

Welcome to OPSM Network - Revolutionizing Soccer Recruiting. OPSM Network is a premier NextJS Application that aims to reinvent the soccer recruitment process by offering a unique blend of in-person testing and online soccer recruiting profiles. It is a groundbreaking solution providing an enhanced recruiting experience.

## Installation

As OPSM Network is still under development, stay tuned for detailed installation information.

## Features

Our platform provides:

1. In-person Testing: Attend testing sessions to showcase your skills.
2. Online Profiles: Create your professional profile visible to recruiters.
3. Seamless Recruit: Connects players, coaches and recruiters in a seamless manner.

(Please note the features are still under development and could be subjected to change.)

## How It Works

- Players attend in-person testing events hosted by OPSM Network.
- Results from these events are analyzed and uploaded to individual player profiles.
- Soccer recruiters have access to these profiles for their recruitment process.

Please note, as the product is still under development, this is a simplified workflow and the actual application might work in a different way.
